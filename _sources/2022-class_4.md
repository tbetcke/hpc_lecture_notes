# Class 4 (Monday 31 October)

These tasks are designed to be worked on in the practical class on Monday 31 October.

In this class, we will make heavy use of the [finite difference code for solving a Poisson problem]()
that we wrote in lectures.

## Plan
- Write versions of code with sparse and dense matrices.
- Plot of memory used vs size of problem.
- Using `scipy.sparse.spsolve` and `numpy.linalg.solve`, plot of time to solve vs size of problem.

## Comparing sparse formats
- Plot memory vs size for different sparse formats

## How sparse
- Create 10 by 10 matrix with 1s in N random positions. How big can N get before dense storage becomes better?
- Do the same for 100 by 100 matrix.
